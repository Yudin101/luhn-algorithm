The Luhn algorithm or Luhn formula, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, named after its creator, IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn, is a simple check digit formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers. It is described in US patent 2950048A, granted on 23 August 1960. *[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)*

## Usage
### 1. For luhn_algorithm.py
```bash
python luhn_algorithm.py <number>
```
### 2. For luhn_algorithm.c
```bash
gcc -o luhn_algorithm luhn_algorithm.c
./luhn_algorithm <number>
```
*Replace `<number>` with the number you want to check*
